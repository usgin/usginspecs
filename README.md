==========

This repository is for development of USGIN system specification, best practice, and inforamtional documents. Working copies of documents are edited in this repository, and when they are complete, a 'tag' copy is committed to the usgin repository at  at http://repository.usgin.org for archive and public access.

Please feel free to fork and edit copies, we are interested in thoughtful input from anyone. Contact the repository manager if you are interested in merging your contributions into the master.

Enjoy!
